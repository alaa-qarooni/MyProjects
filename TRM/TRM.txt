1. Calculate clothes washer savings based on the Integrated Modified Energy Factor (IMEF).
The Integrated Modified Energy Factor (IMEF) includes unit operation, standby, water heating, and
drying energy use: "IMEF is the quotient of the capacity of the clothes container, C, divided by the
total clothes washer energy consumption per cycle, with such energy consumption expressed as
the sum of the machine electrical energy consumption, M, the hot water energy consumption, E,
the energy required for removal of the remaining moisture in the wash load, D, and the combined
low-power mode energy consumption" .
The hot water and dryer savings calculated here assumes electric DHW and Dryer (this will be
separated in Step 2).
IMEFsavings = Capacity * (1/IMEFbase - 1/IMEFeff) * Ncycles
Where
Capacity = Clothes Washer capacity (cubic feet)
= Actual. If capacity is unknown assume 3.55 cubic feet
IMEFbase = Integrated Modified Energy Factor of baseline unit
= 1.71
IMEFeff = Integrated Modified Energy Factor of efficient unit
= Actual. If unknown assume average values provided below.
Ncycles = Number of Cycles per year

Refrigerator and Freezer Recycling
D
This measure describes savings from the retirement and recycling of inefficient but operational refrigerators and
freezers. Savings are provided based on a 2013 workpaper provided by Cadmus that used data from a 2012 ComEd
metering study and metering data from a Michigan study, to develop a regression equation that uses key inputs
describing the retired unit. The savings are equivalent to the Unit Energy Consumption of the retired unit and should
be claimed for the assumed remaining useful life of that unit. A part use factor is applied to account for those
secondary units that are not in use throughout the entire year. The reader should note that the regression algorithm
is designed to provide an accurate portrayal of savings for the population as a whole and includes those parameters
that have a significant effect on the consumption. The precision of savings for individual units will vary.
For Net to Gross factor considerations, please refer to section 4.2 Appliance Recycling Protocol of Appendix A: Illinois

Room Air Conditioner Recycling
D
This measure describes the savings resulting from running a drop off service taking existing residential, inefficient
Room Air Conditioner units from service, prior to their natural end of life. This measure assumes that though a
percentage of these units will be replaced this is not captured in the savings algorithm since it is unlikely that the
incentive made someone retire a unit that they weren’t already planning to retire. The savings therefore relate to
the unit being taken off the grid as opposed to entering the secondary market. The Net to Gross factor applied to
these units should incorporate adjustments that account for those participants who would have removed the unit
from the grid anyway.

or booster fans, and improving efficiency of motors. Reducing the runtime of dryers through automatic termination
by temperature and moisture sensors is believed to have the greatest potential for reducing energy use in clothes
dryers . ENERGY STAR provides criteria for both gas and electric clothes dryers.

Fuel Switch/Electrification Measures
Fuel switch / electrification measures must produce positive total energy savings (i.e., reduction in Btus at the
premises) in order to qualify. This is determined as follows:
SiteEnergySavings (MMBTUs) = [FuelSwitchSavings] + [NonFuelSwitchSavings]
FuelSwitchSavings = [(Load/CEFbaseGas * Ncycles * MMBtu_convert * %GasGas] -
[Load/CEFeffElec * Ncycles * %GasGas * 3412/1,000,000]
NonFuelSwitchSavings = [(Load/CEFbaseGas * Ncycles * MMBtu_convert * %ElectricGas] -
[Load/CEFeffElec * Ncycles * %ElectricGas * 3412/1,000,000]
If SiteEnergySavings calculated above is positive, the measure is eligible.
The appropriate savings claim is dependent on which utilities are supporting the measure as provided in a table

This measure can involve fuel switching from fossil fuel to electric.
For the purposes of forecasting load reductions due to fuel switch projects per Section 16-111.5B, changes in site
energy use at the customer’s meter (using ΔkWh algorithm below) adjusted for utility line losses (at-the-busbar
savings), customer switching estimates, NTG, and any other adjustment factors deemed appropriate, should be
used.
The inputs to cost effectiveness screening should reflect the actual impacts on the electric and fuel consumption at
the customer meter and, for fuel switching measures, this will not match the output of the calculation/allocation
methodology presented in the “Electric Energy Savings” and “Fossil Fuel Savings” sections above. Therefore in
addition to the calculation of savings claimed, the following values should be used to assess the cost effectiveness
of the measure.

Ozone Laundry
D
A new ozone laundry system is added-on to new or existing residential clothes washing machine(s) or washing
machines located in multifamily building common areas. The system generates ozone (O ), a naturally occurring
molecule, which helps clean fabrics by chemically reacting with soils in cold water. Adding an ozone laundry
system(s) eliminate the use of chemicals, detergents, and hot water by residential washing machine(s).
Energy savings will be achieved at the domestic hot water heater as it will no longer supply hot water to the washing
machine. Cold water usage by the clothes washer will increase, but overall water usage will stay constant.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, RNC, RF. If applied to other
program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
A new, single-unit ozone laundry system(s) rated for residential clothes washing machines is added-on to new or
existing residential clothes washing machines. The ozone laundry system must be connected to both the hot and
cold water inlets of the clothes washing machine so that hot water from the domestic hot water heater is no longer
provided to the clothes washer.
The ozone laundry system(s) must transfer ozone into the water through:
• Venturi injection
• Bubble diffusion
• Additional applications may be considered upon program review and approval on a case by case basis

Income Qualified: ENERGY STAR and CEE Tier 2 Room Air Conditioner
D
This measure relates to the purchase and installation of a room air conditioning unit that meets ENERGY STAR version
4.0 which is effective October 26th 2015 (equivalent to CEE Tier 1) or CEE Tier 2 minimum qualifying efficiency
specifications, in place of an existing inefficient unit or a newly acquired inefficient unit through the secondary
market. This measure is to be used by programs supporting the installation of efficient Room AC in income qualified
households. The COVID pandemic of 2020 has meant that opportunities for income qualified populations to keep
themselves and their families cool and comfortable during the summer heat have been restricted as access to cooling
centers and air conditioned public areas have become limited. This can result in hospitalization or even death from
heat exhaustion.
It is assumed that the Room AC’s characterized in this measure are being used less as a luxury and more as a necessity
and that access to a single AC unit per household will result in run hours more consistent with central AC usage.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, EREP.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.

To qualify for this measure the new room air conditioning unit must meet the ENERGY STAR version 4.0 (effective
October 26th 2015) efficiency standards presented above.

D L E E
The measure life is assumed to be 12 years.
It is assumed that the baseline unit would need to be replaced with an additional secondary unit after 6 years.
D M C
The actual full cost of the ENERGY STAR unit should be used. If unavailable assume $300. If a CEE Tier 2 unit is
installed assume $508.
The cost of the inefficient secondary market unit is assumed to be $50.
Therefore, where the new unit replaces an existing unit the measure cost is $300 for ENERGY STAR or $508 for CEE
Tier 2, and where there is no existing unit the measure cost is assumed to be $250 for ENERGY STAR or $458 for CEE
Tier 2.
The avoided replacement cost (after 6 years) of the replacement secondary market unit is $50. This cost should be
discounted to present value using the nominal societal discount rate.

Residential Bolt-On Smart Dryer Sensor
D
This measure relates to the installation of a bolt-on smart wifi enabled dryer sensor with cloud data storage access
on a residential gas-fired or electric dryer. A smart dryer sensor is an add-on device, which turns any residential dryer
into a smart dryer. The device consists of
1) a sensor that detects temperature and humidity in the dryer
2) a connected hub with a built-in auto shut-off mechanism
The sensor monitors the temperature and humidity inside the clothes dryer to determine when a load is dry. When
the humidity levels in the dryer fall below a pre-set cut-off at steady state, the device determines that a load is dry.
The sensor then notifies the connected auto shut-off mechanism, cutting off power to the dryer and turning it off.
Residential clothes dryers have not changed significantly in their operation for many years. They typically offer either
a time-dry setting (which uses a set timer) or an auto-dry setting (which uses a built-in moisture sensor to determine
when the clothes are dry). Most built-in manufacturer moisture sensors do not work well and users tend to
predominantly use the time-dry setting. This measure does not apply to dryers with coin operated mechanical
timers, laundromat facilities or commercial clothes dryers. This measure was developed to be applicable to the
following program types: TOS, RF, NC, DI and KITS.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
Natural gas-fired or electric resistance dryers with a residential bolt-on smart dryer sensor installed.
D B E
The base case equipment is a conventional gas-fired or electric resistance residential dryer without a bolt-on smart
dryer sensor installed. The dryer may have an built-in moisture sensor installed. The gas-fired dryer has a natural
gas fuel-fired burner element and an electric powered drum motor.
D L E E
The expected measure life is assumed to be same as that of the clothes dryer, which is 16 years.
D M C
The deemed measure cost is $60 for a new residential bolt-on smart dryer sensor when installed on a gas-fired dryer.
This applies to a non-intrusive bolt-on sensor installed with a magnetically attachable sensor inside the drum and a
wirelessly connected plug with an auto shut-off.
When attached to an electric dryer the deemed measure cost is $150 .
Actual costs should be used when available or if the smart sensor setup is different from the above.

D
This measure relates to Advanced Power Strips – Tier 1 which are multi-plug surge protector power strips with the
ability to automatically disconnect specific connected loads depending upon the power draw of a control load, also
plugged into the strip. Power is disconnected from the switched (controlled) outlets when the control load power
draw is reduced below a certain adjustable threshold, thus turning off the appliances plugged into the switched
outlets. By disconnecting, the standby load of the controlled devices, the overall load of a centralized group of
equipment (i.e. entertainment centers and home office) can be reduced. Uncontrolled outlets are also provided that
are not affected by the control device and so are always providing power to any device plugged into it. This measure
characterization provides savings for a 5-plug strip and a 7-plug strip.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, DI, KITS.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.

Tier 2 Advanced Power Strips (APS) – Residential Audio Visual
D
This measure relates to the installation of a Tier 2 Advanced Power Strip / surge protector for household audio visual
environments (Tier 2 AV APS). Tier 2 AV APS are multi-plug power strips that remove power from audio visual
equipment through intelligent control and monitoring strategies.
By utilizing advanced control strategies such as a countdown timer, external sensors (e.g. of infra-red remote usage
and/or occupancy sensors, true RMS (Root Mean Square) power sensing; both active power loads and standby
power loads of controlled devices are managed by Tier 2 AV APS devices. Monitoring and controlling both active
and standby power loads of controlled devices will reduce the overall load of a centralized group of electrical
equipment (i.e. the home entertainment center). This more intelligent sensing and control process has been
demonstrated to deliver increased energy savings and demand reduction compared with ‘Tier 1 Advanced Power
Strips’.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: DI. If applied to other program
delivery types, the installation characteristics including the number of AV devices under control and an appropriate
in service rate should be verified through evaluation.
Current evaluation is limited to Direct Install applications. Through a Direct Install program it can be assured that
the APS is appropriately set up and the customer is knowledgeable about its function and benefit. It is encouraged
that additional implementation strategies are evaluated to provide an indication of whether the units are
appropriately set up, used with AV equipment and that the customer is knowledgeable about its function and
benefit. This will then facilitate a basis for broadening out the deployment methods of the APS technology
category beyond Direct Install.
D E E
The efficient case is the use of a Tier 2 AV APS in a residential AV (home entertainment) environment that includes
control of at least 2 AV devices with one being the television.
The minimum product specifications for Tier 2 AV APS are:
Safety & longevity
• Product and installation instructions shall comply with 2012 International Fire Code and 2000 NFPA 101 Life
Safety Code (IL Fire Code).
• Third party tested to all applicable UL Standards.
• Contains a resettable circuit breaker
• Incorporates power switching electromechanical relays rated for 100,000 switching cycles at full 15 amp
load (equivalent to more than 10 years of use).
Energy efficiency functionality
• Calculates real power as the time average of the instantaneous power, where instantaneous power is the
product of instantaneous voltage and current.
• Delivers a warning when the countdown timer begins before an active power down event and maintains
the warning until countdown is concluded or reset by use of the remote or other specified signal
• Uses an automatically adjustable power switching threshold.

Centrally Ducted Air Source Heat Pump
D
A heat pump provides heating or cooling by moving heat between indoor and outdoor air. This measure relates to a
unitary central heat pump (split or packaged) with conditioned air delivered to the home via ductwork. This
prescriptive measure does not apply to known installations where existing fuel-fired heating systems remain in place
to provide back up heat at low temperatures (“hybrid systems”). Savings from such installations should be calculated
on a custom basis if done outside of midstream type offerings where installation details are tracked.
This measure characterizes:
a) New Construction:
• The installation of a new residential sized (<= 65,000 Btu/hr) Air Source Heat Pump system meeting
ENERGY STAR efficiency standards presented below in a new home.
• Note the baseline in this case should be determined via EM&V and the algorithms are provided to
allow savings to be calculated from any baseline condition.
b) Time of Sale:
• The installation of a new residential sized (<= 65,000 Btu/hr) Air Source Heat Pump that is more
efficient than required by federal standards. This relates to the replacement of an existing unit at
the end of its useful life.
• Note the baseline in this case is an equivalent replacement system to that which exists currently
in the home. Where unknown, the baseline should be determined via EM&V and the algorithms
are provided to allow savings to be calculated from any baseline condition.
• The allocation of savings is dependent on whether an incentive for the installation has been
provided by both a gas and electric utility, just an electric utility or just a gas utility.
c) Early Replacement:
The early removal of functioning electric or gas heating and/or cooling (SEER 10 or under if present)
systems from service, prior to its natural end of life, and replacement with a new high efficiency
air source heat pump unit.
Note the baseline in this case is the existing equipment being replaced. The allocation of savings is
dependent on whether an incentive for the installation has been provided by both a gas and
electric utility, just an electric utility or just a gas utility.
Early Replacement determination will be based on meeting the following conditions:
• The existing unit is operational when replaced, or
• The existing unit requires minor repairs (<$276 per ton).
• All other conditions will be considered Time of Sale.
The Baseline SEER of the existing unit replaced:
• If the SEER of the existing unit is known and <=10, the Baseline SEER is the actual SEER
value of the unit replaced. If the SEER is >10, the Baseline SEER = 14.
• If the SEER of the existing unit is unknown use assumptions in variable list below
(SEER_exist and HSPF_exist).
• If the operational status or repair cost of the existing unit is unknown, use time of sale

Additional savings are attributed to the Quality Installation (QI) of the system. QI programs should follow industry
standards such as those described in ENERGY STAR Verified HVAC Installation Program (ESVI), ANSI ACCA QI5 and
QI9vp. This must include considerations of system design (including sizing, matching, ventilation calculations) and
equipment installation (including static pressure, airflow, refrigerant charge) and may also consider distribution.

Early replacement / Retrofit: The baseline for this measure is the efficiency of the existing heating and cooling
equipment for the assumed remaining useful life of the existing unit and a new baseline heating and cooling system
for the remainder of the measure life (as provided in table above).
When unknown, default early replacement efficiency assumptions are 9.70 SEER, 7.83 EER, 5.24 HSPF and 80% AFUE.
Consistent with TRM Volume 1 Section 2.3.1 for midstream programs or other cases where the existing condition is
unknown, it may be appropriate to apply a deemed percent split of Time of Sale and Early Replacement assumptions
based on evaluation results

for a new 84% AFUE boiler and $952 per ton for new baseline Central AC replacement ).
Early Replacement: The actual full installation cost of the Air Source Heat Pump (including any necessary electrical
or distribution upgrades required) should be used. The assumed deferred cost (after the appropriate number of
years described above in the ‘Deemed Lifetime of Efficient Equipment’ section) of replacing existing equipment with
a new baseline unit is assumed to be $7,527 + $688 per ton for a new baseline Air Source Heat Pump, or $2,296 for
a new baseline 80% AFUE furnace or $4,627 for a new 84% AFUE boiler and $1,092 per ton for new baseline Central
AC replacement. This future cost should be discounted to present value using the nominal societal discount rate.
If the install cost of the efficient Air Source Heat Pump is unknown, assume the following (note these costs are per
ton of unit capacity);
table is here
Fuel switch scenarios are likely to require additional installation work which may include adding new electrical
circuits, capping existing gas lines and upgrading electrical panels. These costs are likely to range significantly and
actual values should be used wherever possible. If unknown, assume an additional $2,000 for fuel switch
installations.

Note for Early Replacement measures, the efficiency and Fe terms of the existing unit should be used for the
remaining useful life of the existing equipment (6 years for ASHP and Central AC, 7 years for furnace, 8 years for
boilers, 16 years for electric resistance), and the efficiency and Fe terms for a new baseline unit should be used for
the remaining years of the measure. See assumptions below.
Programs where existing system unknown
In programs where the existing fuel or system type is unknown, savings should be apportioned between the Fuel
Switch and Non- Fuel Switch scenarios, as follows:
Savings from Non-Fuel Switch (kWh) = (1 – %FuelSwitch) * ΔkWhNon Fuel Switch
Plus
Savings from Fuel Switch (MMBtu converted to appropriate fuel as table above)
= %FuelSwitch * SiteEnergySavings (MMBTUs)

This measure can involve fuel switching from fossil fuel to electric.
For the purposes of forecasting load reductions due to fuel switch ASHP projects per Section 16-111.5B, changes in
site energy use at the customer’s meter (using ΔkWh algorithm below), customer switching estimates, NTG, and any
other adjustment factors deemed appropriate, should be used.
The inputs to cost effectiveness screening should reflect the actual impacts on the electric and fuel consumption at
the customer meter and, for fuel switching measures, should therefore reflect the decrease in one fuel and increase
in another, as opposed to the single savings value calculated in the “Electric and Fossil Fuel Energy Savings” section
above. Therefore in addition to the calculation of savings claimed, the following values should be used to assess the
cost effectiveness of the measure. For Early Replacement measures, the efficiency and Fe terms of the existing unit

This measure characterizes:
a) Time of Sale:
a. The installation of a new residential sized (<= 65,000 Btu/hr) Central Air Conditioning ducted split
system meeting ENERGY STAR SEER efficiency standards presented below. This could relate to the
replacement of an existing unit at the end of its useful life, or the installation of a new system in a
new home.
b) Early Replacement:
Early Replacement determination will be based on meeting the following conditions:
• The existing unit is operational when replaced, or
• The existing unit requires minor repairs (<$190 per ton).
• All other conditions will be considered Time of Sale.
The Baseline SEER of the existing Central Air Conditioning unit replaced:
• If the SEER of the existing unit is known and <=10, the Baseline SEER is the actual SEER
value of the unit replaced. If the SEER is >10, the Baseline SEER = 13.
• If the SEER of the existing unit is unknown, use assumptions in variable list below
(SEER_exist).
• If the operational status or repair cost of the existing unit is unknown, use time of sale
assumptions.
A weighted average early replacement rate is provided for use in downstream programs when the
actual baseline early replacement rate is unknown.

Quality Installation:
Additional savings are attributed to the Quality Installation (QI) of the system. QI programs should follow industry
standards such as those described in ENERGY STAR Verified HVAC Installation Program (ESVI), ANSI ACCA QI5 and

January 1, 2023. The new specifications require central air conditioners to meet the following minimum efficiency
requirements:
• Split system central air conditioners – 15.2 SEER2 and 12.0 EER2
• Single package central air conditioners – 15.2 SEER2 and 11.5 EER2
The measure characterization recommends sourcing the efficiency specifications from the actually installed
equipment. If those values are not known, the default equipment efficiency recommendations are conservatively
based on ENERGY STAR version 5.0 specifications.
The following conversion factors are recommended for use if the efficient equipment is not rated under the new
testing procedure:
SEER = SEER2 / X
EER = EER2 / X

The baseline for the Time of Sale measure is based on the current Federal Standard efficiency level; 13 SEER and an
estimate of expected peak rated efficiency of 10.5 EER. It is assumed that ‘Quality Installation’ did not occur.
The baseline for the early replacement measure is the efficiency of the existing equipment for the assumed
remaining useful life of the unit and the new baseline as defined above for the remainder of the measure life.
Consistent with TRM Volume 1 Section 2.3.1 for midstream programs or other cases where the existing condition is
unknown, it may be appropriate to apply a deemed percent split of Time of Sale and Early Replacement assumptions
based on evaluation results
Note: New Federal Standards affecting central air conditioners become effective January 1, 2023. The new standards

to have a minimum efficiency rating meeting the following:
• Split system air conditioners – 13.4 SEER2
• Single-package air conditioners – 13.4 SEER2
These new federal standards will be adopted by the program, beginning 1/1/2024. For the 2023 program year, the

Duct Insulation and Sealing
D
This measure describes evaluating the savings associated with performing duct sealing using mastic sealant or metal
tape to the distribution system of homes with either central air conditioning or a ducted heating system.
Two methodologies for estimating the savings associate from sealing the ducts are provided. The first preferred
method requires the use of a blower door and the second requires careful inspection of the duct work.
1. Modified Blower Door Subtraction – this technique is described in detail on the Energy Conservatory
website. See ‘The Energy Conservatory_Blower-Door-Subtraction-Method.pdf’.
2. Evaluation of Distribution Efficiency – this methodology requires the evaluation of three duct
characteristics below, and use of the Building Performance Institutes ‘Distribution Efficiency Look-Up
Table’; See ‘DistributionEfficiencyTable-BlueSheet.pdf’.
a. Percentage of duct work found within the conditioned space
b. Duct leakage evaluation
c. Duct insulation evaluation
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF. If applied to other program types,
the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
The efficient condition is sealed duct work throughout the unconditioned or semi-conditioned space in the home. A
non‐conditioned space is defined as a space outside of the thermal envelope of the building that is not intentionally
heated for occupancy (crawl space, roof attic, etc.). A semi-conditioned space is defined as a space within the thermal
envelop that is not intentionally heated for occupancy (unfinished basement).
D B E
The existing baseline condition is leaky duct work within the unconditioned or semi-conditioned space in the home.
D L E E
The assumed lifetime of this measure is 20 years.
Note a mid-life adjustment to account for replacement of HVAC equipment during the measure life should be applied
after 10 years. See section below for detail.

Methodology 1: Modified Blower Door Subtraction
a) Determine Duct Leakage rate before and after performing duct sealing:
Duct Leakage (CFM50DL) = (CFM50Whole House – CFM50Envelope Only) * SCF
Where:
CFM50Whole House = Standard Blower Door test result finding Cubic Feet per Minute at 50 Pascal
pressure differential
CFM50Envelope Only = Blower Door test result finding Cubic Feet per Minute at 50 Pascal pressure
differential with all supply and return registers sealed.
SCF = Subtraction Correction Factor to account for underestimation of duct leakage
due to connections between the duct system and the home. Determined by
measuring pressure in duct system with registers sealed and using look up table
provided by Energy Conservatory.
b) Calculate duct leakage reduction, convert to CFM25DL and factor in Supply and Return Loss Factors
Duct Leakage Reduction (∆CFM25DL) = (Pre CFM50DL – Post CFM50DL) * 0.64 * (SLF + RLF)
Where:

Mid-Life Adjustment
In order to account for the likely replacement of existing heating and cooling equipment during the lifetime of this
measure, a mid-life adjustment should be applied.
For electric HVAC, to calculate the adjustment, re-calculate the savings using the algorithms in the ‘Electric Energy
Savings’ section using the following new baseline system efficiency assumptions:
table is here
For gas fueled systems, because the algorithm uses input capacity (which already accounts for the equipment
efficiency), the change in equipment efficiency needs to be accounted for. Therefore re-calculate the savings using
the following algorithm:

Furnace Blower Motor
D
This measure describes savings from a brushless permanent magnet (BPM) motor (known and referred in this
measure as an electronically commutated motor (ECM)) compared to a lower efficiency motor. Time of Sale and
New Construction replacement scenarios no longer apply to this measure, as federal standards make ECM blower
fan motors a requirement for residential furnaces. Savings however are available from retrofitting an ECM motor
into an existing furnace, or replacing an operational inefficient furnace with a new furnace with an ECM prior to the
end of its life.
This measure characterizes the electric savings associated with the fan and the interactive negative therm savings
due to a reduction in waste heat of the fan when operating in heating mode.
Savings decrease sharply with static pressure so duct improvements, and clean, low pressure drop filters can
maximize savings. Savings occur when the blower is used for heating, cooling as well as when it is used for continuous
ventilation, but only if the non-ECM motor would have been used for continuous ventilation too. If the resident runs
the ECM blower continuously because it is a more efficient motor and would not run a non-ECM motor that way,
savings are near zero and possibly negative. This characterization uses a 2016 Ameren Illinois study of ECM blower
motors in Illinois, which accounted for the effects of this behavioral impact through surveyed results of impacted
homeowners.
Retrofitting an existing blower motor with a new ECM reduces the potential impact of the high efficiency motor over
a new system designed for an ECM blower motor because existing systems were not designed to capitalize and take
advantage of the ECM’s multi-staging features. Energy and demand savings are limited to the efficiency gains from
the motor itself.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF, EREP
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
A brushless permanent magnet (ECM) blower motor, also known by the trademark ECM, BLDC, and other names.

A non-ECM blower motor.
D L E E
The expected measure life is assumed to be 6 years, which is the remaining life of existing furnaces.

The capital cost for this measure as a retrofit should be actual if known; if unknown, assume $350. In cases of
furnace early replacements, it is assumed the incremental cost of the ECM is $0.

ECMs installed in high efficiency CACs and ASHPs do not generate peak demand cooling savings if demand savings
are claimed for these systems. However, some savings are realized for fans operating in circulation mode, even
during peak demand cooling periods. Circulation mode operation during peak cooling periods would only occur when
a system is not operating in cooling mode, with the percent time in circulation mode calculated using the summer
system peak and PJM peak coincidence factors. A metering study found 23% of fans operated continuously during
the summer peak periods; therefore, ECMs do generate some demand savings during peak periods (when the
system is not cooling). ECMs installed with CACs or ASHPs not receiving a rebate improve the cooling efficiency and
therefore generate additional peak demand savings (when the system is cooling). Demand savings vary with system
size and can be calculated using factors listed in the demand savings calculation table in the next section which
incorporate coincidence with peak in their calculation.

Gas High Efficiency Boiler
D
High efficiency boilers achieve most gas savings through the utilization of a sealed combustion chamber and multiple
heat exchangers that remove a significant portion of the waste heat from flue gasses. Because multiple heat
exchangers are used to remove waste heat from the escaping flue gasses, some of the flue gasses condense and
must be drained.
This measure characterizes:

could relate to the replacement of an existing unit at the end of its useful life, or the installation of
a new system in a new home.
b) Early Replacement:
Early Replacement determination will be based on meeting the following conditions:
• The existing unit is operational when replaced, or
• The existing unit requires minor repairs (<$709).
• All other conditions will be considered Time of Sale.
The Baseline AFUE of the existing unit replaced:
• If the AFUE of the existing unit is known and <=75%, the Baseline AFUE is the actual AFUE
value of the unit replaced. If the AFUE is >75%, the Baseline AFUE = 84%.

BTU measurement to ensure that newly installed equipment is operating according to manufacturers’ published
potential performance. Installed equipment operating efficiency is largely dependent on the efficiency rating of the
equipment, the skill of the installation contractor, the degree to which the equipment has aged or drifted from initial
settings, and the system level constraints. When one or more of these key dependencies are operating sub-
optimally, the overall efficiency of the equipment is degraded. A Verified Quality Install identifies sub-optimal
performance and prescribes a solution during furnace installation.

The expected measure life is assumed to be 25 years.
For early replacement, the remaining life of existing equipment is assumed to be 6 years for ASHP and Central AC, 7
years for furnace, 8 years for boilers and GSHP and 25 years for electric resistance.
D M C
New Construction and Time of Sale: The actual installed cost of the Ground Source Heat Pump (including any
necessary electrical or distribution upgrades required) should be used (default of $3957 per ton), minus the
assumed installation cost of the baseline equipment ($6562 + $600 per ton for ASHP or $2011 for a new baseline
80% AFUE furnace, or $4053 for a new 84% AFUE boiler, and $952 per ton for new baseline Central AC
replacement ).
Early Replacement: The actual full installation cost of the Ground Source Heat Pump should be used (including any
necessary electrical or distribution upgrades required). If the install cost is unknown a default is provided above,
however because these assumptions do not include any additional costs that may be required for fuel switch
scenarios, these defaults should not be used and actual costs should always be used for fuel switch measures.
The assumed deferred cost (after 8 years) of replacing existing equipment with a new baseline unit is assumed to be
$7,527 + $688 per ton for a new baseline Air Source Heat Pump, or $2,296 for a new baseline 80% AFUE furnace, or
$4,627 for a new 84% AFUE boiler, and 1,047 per ton for new baseline Central AC replacement. This future cost
should be discounted to present value using the nominal societal discount rate.

Note for purpose of cost effectiveness screening a fuel switch scenario, the heating kWh increase and cooling kWh
decrease should be calculated separately such that the appropriate loadshape (i.e., Loadshape R09 - Residential
Electric Space Heat and Loadshape R08 – Residential Cooling respectively) can be applied.

The summer peak coincidence factor for cooling is provided in two different ways below. The first is used to estimate
peak savings during the utility peak hour and is most indicative of actual peak benefits, and the second represents
the average savings over the defined summer peak period and is presented so that savings can be bid into PJM’s
capacity market.

Non-fuel switch measures:
ΔkWh = [Cooling savings] + [Heating savings] + [DHW savings]
= [FLHcool * Capacity_cooling * (1/SEERbase – 1/EERPL)/1000] + [HeatLoad* (1/HSPFbase –

Fuel switch measures:
Fuel switch measures must produce positive total lifecycle energy savings (i.e., reduction in Btus at the premises) in
order to qualify. This is determined as follows (note for early replacement measures the lifetime savings should be
calculated by calculating savings for the remaining useful life of the existing equipment and for the remaining
measure life):
SiteEnergySavings (MMBTUs) = FuelSwitchSavings + NonFuelSwitchSavings
FuelSwitchSavings = GasHeatReplaced – GSHPSiteHeatConsumed
NonFuelSwitchSavings = FurnaceFanSavings + GSHPSiteCoolingImpact + GSHPSiteWaterImpact
GasHeatReplaced = [(HeatLoad * 1/AFUEbase) / 1,000,000]
FurnaceFanSavings = (FurnaceFlag * HeatLoad * 1/AFUEbase * Fe) / 1,000,000
GSHPSiteHeatConsumed = [HeatLoad * (1/(COPPL * 3.412))/1000] * 3412) / 1,000,000
GSHPSiteCoolingImpact = [FLHcool * Capacity_GSHPcool * (1/SEERbase – 1/EERPL)/1000] * 3412) /
1,000,000
GSHPSiteWaterImpactGas = (%DHWDisplaced * (1/EFGas * GPD * Household * 365.25 * γWater * (TOUT – TIN)

GSHPSiteWaterImpactElectric = (%DHWDisplaced * (1/EFElec * GPD * Household * 365.25 * γWater * (TOUT –
TIN) * 1.0)) / 1,000,000
If SiteEnergySavings calculated above is positive, the measure is eligible.

This measure can involve fuel switching from gas to electric.
For the purposes of forecasting load reductions due to fuel switch GSHP projects per Section 16-111.5B, changes in
site energy use at the customer’s meter (using ΔkWh algorithm below), customer switching estimates, NTG, and any
other adjustment factors deemed appropriate, should be used.
The inputs to cost effectiveness screening should reflect the actual impacts on the electric and fuel consumption at
the customer meter and, for fuel switching measures, should therefore reflect the decrease in one fuel and increase
in another, as opposed to the single savings value calculated in the “Electric and Fossil Fuel Energy Savings” section
above.Therefore in addition to the calculation of savings claimed, the following values should be used to assess the
cost effectiveness of the measure. For Early Replacement measures, the efficiency terms of the existing unit should
be used for the remaining useful life of the existing equipment (6 years for ASHP and Central AC, 6 years for furnace,
8 years for boilers or GSHP, 15 years for electric resistance), and the efficiency terms for a new baseline unit should
be used for the remaining years of the measure.

This market opportunity measure is split into the purchase of a new bathroom fan for typical usage, and to meet the
need for continuous mechanical ventilation due to reduced air-infiltration from a tighter building shell. In retrofit
projects, existing fans may be too loud, or insufficient in other ways, to be operated as required for proper
ventilation. This measure assumes fan capacities between 10 and 200 CFM rated at a sound level of less than 2.0
sones at 0.1 inches of water column static pressure, or 50 CFM if used for continuous ventilation. All eligible
installations shall be sized to provide the mechanical ventilation rate indicated by ASHRAE 62.2.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.3.11 Programmable Thermostats
Programmable Thermostats
D
This measure characterizes the household energy savings from the installation of a new or reprogramming of an
existing Programmable Thermostat for reduced heating energy consumption through temperature set-back during
unoccupied or reduced demand times. Because a literature review was not conclusive in providing a defensible
source of prescriptive cooling savings from programmable thermostats, cooling savings from programmable
thermostats are assumed to be zero for this version of the measure. It is not appropriate to assume a similar pattern
of savings from setting a thermostat down during the heating season and up during the cooling season. Note that
the EPA’s EnergyStar program is developing a new specification for this project category, and if/when evaluation
results demonstrate consistent cooling savings, subsequent versions of this measure will revisit this assumption.
Since energy savings are applicable at the household level, savings should only be claimed for one thermostat of any
type (i.e., one programmable thermostat or one advanced thermostat), installation of multiple thermostats per
home does not accrue additional savings.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, RF, DI.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
The criteria for this measure are established by replacement of a manual-only temperature control, with one that
has the capability to adjust temperature setpoints according to a schedule without manual intervention. This
category of equipment is broad and rapidly advancing in regards to the capability, and usability of the controls and
their sophistication in setpoint adjustment and information display, but for the purposes of this characterization,
eligibility is perhaps most simply defined by what it is not: a manual only temperature control.
For the thermostat reprogramming measure, the auditor consults with the homeowner to determine an appropriate
set back schedule, reprograms the thermostat and educates the homeowner on its appropriate use.
D B E
For new thermostats the baseline is a non-programmable thermostat requiring manual intervention to change
temperature setpoint.
For the purpose of thermostat reprogramming, an existing programmable thermostat that an auditor determines is
being used in override mode or otherwise effectively being operated like a manual thermostat.
D L E E
The expected measure life of a programmable thermostat is assumed to be 16 years, however concerns over
persistence over a population result in the application of a mid-life adjustment to reduce annual savings during the
measure lifetime. For reprogramming, the measure life of 2 years is assumed.
D M C
Actual material and labor costs should be used if the implementation method allows. If unknown (e.g., through a

Mid-Life Baseline Adjustment
Due to concerns that across a population the savings for programmable thermostats are likely to decline through
the technical lifetime of the thermostat, a mid-life adjustment should be applied. The mid-life adjustment should
be applied in year 6 (i.e., after five years of full savings) and is calculated as 28%. This results in a consistent lifetime
savings as applying a 50% reduction to the technical lifetime. This adjustment should be applied to both electric or
therm heating savings.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.3.12 Ductless Heat Pumps
Ductless Heat Pumps
D
A heat pump provides heating or cooling by moving heat between indoor and outdoor air. This measure relates to a
split heat pump with an outdoor unit and single or multi indoor units providing conditioned air.
This measure is designed to calculate electric savings for the installation of a ductless mini-split heat pump (DMSHP).
DMSHPs save energy in heating mode because they provide heat more efficiently than electric resistance heat and
central ASHP systems. Additionally, DMSHPs use less fan energy to move heat and don’t incur heat loss through a
duct distribution system.
For cooling, the proposed savings calculations are aligned with those of typical replacement systems. DMSHPs save
energy in cooling mode because they provide cooling capacity more efficiently than other types of unitary cooling
equipment. A DMSHP installed in a home with a central ASHP system will save energy by offsetting some of the
cooling energy of the ASHP. In order for this measure to apply, the control strategy for the heat pump is assumed
to be chosen to maximize savings per installer recommendation.
This measure characterizes the following scenarios:
a) New Construction:
a. The installation of a new DMSHP meeting efficiency standards required by the program in a new
home.
b. Note the baseline in this case should be determined via EM&V and the algorithms are provided to
allow savings to be calculated from any baseline condition.
b) Time of Sale:
a. The planned installation of a new DMSHP meeting efficiency standards required by the program
to replace an existing system(s) that does not meet the criteria for early replacement described in
section c below.
b. Note the baseline in this case is an equivalent replacement system to that which exists currently
in the home. Where unknown, the baseline should be determined via EM&V and the algorithms
are provided to allow savings to be calculated from any baseline condition. The calculation of
savings is dependent on whether an incentive for the installation has been provided by both a gas
and electric utility, just an electric utility or just a gas utility.
c) Early Replacement/Retrofit:
a. The early removal or displacement of functioning either electric or gas space heating and/or
cooling systems from service, prior to the natural end of life, and replacement with a new DMSHP.
b. Note the baseline in this case is the existing equipment being replaced/displaced. The calculation
of savings is dependent on whether an incentive for the installation has been provided by both a
gas and electric utility, just an electric utility or just a gas utility.
c. Early Replacement determination will be based on meeting the following conditions:
• The existing unit is operational when replaced/displaced, or
2023 IL TRM v11.0 Vol. 3_September 22, 2022_FINAL Page 175 of 479

• The existing unit requires minor repairs, defined as costing less than:
table is here
• All other conditions will be considered Time of Sale.
d. The Baseline efficiency of the existing unit replaced:
• If the efficiency of the existing unit is less than the maximum shown below, the Baseline
efficiency is the actual efficiency value of the unit replaced. If the efficiency is greater than
the maximum, the Baseline efficiency is shown in the “New Baseline” column below:

• If the efficiency of the existing unit is unknown, use assumptions in variable list below
(SEER, HSPF or AFUE exist).
• If the operational status or repair cost of the existing unit is unknown use time of sale
assumptions.

baseline early replacement rates are unknown.

For these products, baseline equipment includes Air Conditioning and Space Heating:
New Construction:
To calculate savings with an electric baseline, the baseline equipment is assumed to be an Air Source Heat Pump
meeting the Federal Standard efficiency level; 14 SEER, 8.2 HSPF and 11 EER.
To calculate savings with a furnace/central AC baseline, the baseline equipment is assumed to be an 80% AFUE
Furnace and central AC meeting the Federal Standard efficiency level; 13 SEER, 10.5 EER.
Time of Sale: The baseline for this measure is a new replacement unit of the same system type as the existing unit,
meeting the baselines provided below.
table is here
Early replacement / Retrofit: The baseline for this measure is the efficiency of the existing heating and cooling
equipment for the assumed remaining useful life of the existing unit and a new baseline heating and cooling system
for the remainder of the measure life (as provided in table above). Note that in order to claim cooling savings, there
must be an existing air conditioning system.
Where unknown, early replacement efficiency assumptions are 9.95 SEER, 9.01 EER, 5.07 HSPF and 63% AFUE.

unknown, it may be appropriate to apply a deemed percent split of Time of Sale and Early Replacement assumptions
based on evaluation results
For multifamily buildings, each residence must have existing individual heating equipment. Multifamily residences
with central heating do not qualify for this characterization.
Note: New Federal Standards affecting heat pumps become effective January 1, 2023. The new standards effective
in 2023, require any residential heat pump manufactured in, or imported into, the United States to have a minimum
efficiency rating meeting the following:
• Split system heat pump – 14.3 SEER2 and 7.5 HSPF2
• Single-package heat pump – 13.4 SEER2 and 6.7 HSPF2
These new federal standards will be adopted by the program, beginning 1/1/2024. For the 2023 program year, the
baseline equipment efficiencies are detailed in this section by replacement scenario.

The expected measure life is assumed to be 15 years.

New Construction and Time of Sale: The actual installed cost of the DMSHP (including any necessary electrical or

below:
table is here
Early Replacement/retrofit (replacing existing equipment): The actual full installation cost of the DMSHP (including
any necessary electrical or distribution upgrades required) should be used. The assumed deferred cost (after 8 years)
of replacing existing equipment with a new baseline unit is assumed to be $7,527 + $688 per ton for a new baseline
Air Source Heat Pump, or $2,296 for a new baseline 80% AFUE furnace or $4,627 for a new 84% AFUE boiler and
$1,047 per ton for new baseline Central AC replacement. If replacing electric resistance heat, there is no deferred
replacement cost. This future cost should be discounted to present value using the nominal societal discount rate.
Where the DMSHP is a supplemental HVAC system, the full installation cost of the DMSHP (including any necessary
electrical or distribution upgrades required) should be used without a deferred replacement cost.
If the install cost is unknown a default is provided above. Fuel switch scenarios are likely to require additional
installation work which may include adding new electrical circuits, capping existing gas lines and upgrading electrical
panels. These costs are likely to range significantly and actual values should be used wherever possible. If unknown,
assume an additional $300 for fuel switch installations.

The summer peak coincidence factor for cooling is provided in four different ways below. The first two relate to the

Note for Early Replacement measures, the efficiency and Fe terms of the existing unit should be used for the
remaining useful life of the existing equipment (6 years for ASHP and Central AC, 6 years for furnace, 8 years for

the remaining years of the measure. See assumptions below.

Switch and Non- Fuel Switch scenarios, as follows:

This measure can involve fuel switching from gas to electric.
For the purposes of forecasting load reductions due to fuel switch DMSHP projects per Section 16-111.5B, changes
in site energy use at the customer’s meter (using ΔkWh algorithm below), customer switching estimates, NTG, and
any other adjustment factors deemed appropriate, should be used.
The inputs to cost effectiveness screening should reflect the actual impacts on the electric and fuel consumption at
the customer meter and, for fuel switching measures, should therefore reflect the decrease in one fuel and increase
in another, as opposed to the single savings value calculated in the “Electric and Fossil Fuel Energy Savings” section
above. Therefore in addition to the calculation of savings claimed, the following values should be used to assess the
cost effectiveness of the measure. For Early Replacement measures, the efficiency terms of the existing unit should
be used for the remaining useful life of the existing equipment (6 years for ASHP and Central AC, 6 years for furnace,
8 years for boilers or GSHP, 15 years for electric resistance), and the efficiency terms for a new baseline unit should
be used for the remaining years of the measure.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.3.14 Boiler Reset Controls
Boiler Reset Controls
D
This measure relates to improving system efficiency by adding controls to residential heating boilers to vary the
boiler entering water temperature relative to heating load as a function of the outdoor air temperature to save
energy. The water can be run a little cooler during fall and spring, and a little hotter during the coldest parts of the
winter. A boiler reset control has two temperature sensors - one outside the house and one in the boiler water. As
the outdoor temperature goes up and down, the control adjusts the water temperature setting to the lowest setting
that is meeting the house heating demand. There are also limits in the controls to keep a boiler from operating
outside of its safe performance range.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF.
D E E
Natural gas single family residential customer adding boiler reset controls capable of resetting the boiler supply
water temperature in an inverse fashion with outdoor air temperature. The system must be set so that the minimum
temperature is not more than 10 degrees above manufacturer’s recommended minimum return temperature. This
boiler reset measure is limited to existing condensing boilers serving a single family residence. Boiler reset controls
for non-condensing boilers in single family residences should be implemented as a custom measure, and the cost-
effectiveness should be confirmed.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.3.15 ENERGY STAR Ceiling Fan
ENERGY STAR Ceiling Fan
D
A ceiling fan/light unit meeting the efficiency specifications of ENERGY STAR version 4.0 is installed in place of a
model meeting the federal standard. ENERGY STAR qualified ceiling fan/light combination units are over 60% more
efficient than conventional fan/light units and use improved motors and blade designs.
Due to the savings from this measure being derived from more efficient ventilation and more efficient lighting, and
the loadshape and measure life for each component being very different, the savings are split into the component
parts and should be claimed together. Lighting savings should be estimated utilizing the 5.5.9 LED Fixtures measure.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, RF.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
The efficient equipment is defined as an ENERGY STAR certified ceiling fan with integral CFL or LED bulbs. Upon
review of the ENERGY STAR Qualified Products List, it was determined that 91% of ceiling fans with integrated light
kits leverage LED lamps; with the remaining 9% using CFLs. Concurrently, ENERGY STAR criteria require ceiling
fans with light kits to provide the consumer with either CFLs or LEDs. In the cases where light kits require screw-base
sockets, the efficient lamps have to be included in the packaging of the ceiling fan.
D B E
The baseline equipment is assumed to be a standard fan with efficient incandescent or halogen light bulbs.
Production of 100W, standard efficacy incandescent lamps ended in 2012 followed by restrictions on 75W in 2013
and 60W and 40W in 2014, due to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). Finally, a provision in
the EISA regulations requires that by January 1, 2020, all lamps meet efficiency criteria of at least 45 lumens per
watt, in essence making the baseline equivalent to a current day CFL. Therefore the measure life (number of years
that savings should be claimed) for the lighting portion of the savings should be reduced once the assumed lifetime
of the bulb exceeds 2020. Due to expected delay in clearing retail inventory and to account for the operating life of
a halogen incandescent potentially spanning over 2020, this shift is assumed not to occur until 2021.
Effective January 21, 2020, all ceiling fan light kits manufactured after this date must be packaged with lamps to fill
all screw-base sockets, further limiting the potential for inefficient light bulbs to be utilized. Additionally, ceiling fan
light kits with pin-based sockets for fluorescent lamps must use electronic ballasts. Integrated ceiling fan light kits
must adhere to the same lighting efficiency requirements.
D L E E
The fan savings measure life is assumed to be 10 years.
The lighting savings measure life is assumed to be 1 year for lighting savings for units installed in 2020 (see 5.5.9 LED
Fixtures measure).

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.3.16 Advanced Thermostats
Advanced Thermostats
D
This measure characterizes the household energy savings from the installation of a new thermostat(s) for reduced
heating and cooling consumption through a configurable schedule of temperature setpoints (like a programmable
thermostat) and automatic variations to that schedule to better match HVAC system runtimes to meet occupant
comfort needs. These schedules may be defaults, established through user interaction, and be changed manually at
the device or remotely through a web or mobile app. Automatic variations to that schedule could be driven by local
sensors and software algorithms, and/or through connectivity to an internet software service. Data triggers to
automatic schedule changes might include, for example: occupancy/activity detection, arrival & departure of
conditioned spaces, optimization based on historical or population-specific trends, weather data and forecasts.
This class of products and services are relatively new, diverse, and rapidly changing. Generally, the savings expected
for this measure aren’t yet established at the level of individual features, but rather at the system level and how it
performs overall. Like programmable thermostats, it is not suitable to assume that heating and cooling savings follow
a similar pattern of usage and savings opportunity, and so here too this measure treats these savings independently.
Note that this is an active area of ongoing work to better map features to savings value, and establish standards of
performance measurement based on field data so that a standard of efficiency can be developed. Since energy
savings are applicable at the household level, savings should only be claimed for one thermostat of any type (i.e.,
one programmable thermostat or one advanced thermostat), and installation of multiple thermostats per home
does not accrue additional savings.
Note that though these devices and service could potentially be used as part of a demand response program, the

The criteria for this measure are established by replacement of a manual-only or programmable thermostat, with
one that has the default enabled capability—or the capability to automatically—establish a schedule of temperature
setpoints according to driving device inputs above and beyond basic time and temperature data of conventional
programmable thermostats. As summarized in the description, this category of products and services is broad and
rapidly advancing in regard to their capability, usability, and sophistication, but at a minimum must be capable of
two-way communication and exceed the typical performance of manual and conventional programmable
thermostats through the automatic or default capabilities described above.

In the absence of conclusive results from empirical studies on peak savings, the TAC agreed to a temporary
assumption of 50% of the cooling coincidence factor, acknowledging that while the savings from the advanced
Thermostat will track with the cooling load, the impact during peak periods may be lower. This is an assumption that
could use future evaluation to improve these estimates.

Gas High Efficiency Combination Boiler
D
Space heating boilers are pressure vessels that transfer heat to water for use in space heating. Boilers either heat
water using a heat exchanger that works like an instantaneous water heater or by adding/connecting a separate
tank with an internal heat exchanger to the boiler. A combination boiler contains a separate heat exchanger that
heats water for domestic hot water use. Qualifying combination boilers must be whole-house units used for both
space heating and domestic water heating with one appliance and energy source. Only participants who have a
natural gas account with a participating natural gas utility are eligible for this rebate.
Optionally, when applying an early replacement rate for two-in-one boiler upgrades, the following weighted average
is provided for use in downstream programs when the actual baseline early replacement rates are unknown.

Thermostatic Radiator Valves – Provisional Measure
D
Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs) are installed on hydronic or steam radiators to provide temperature control
within a room or space. The TRV is a self-regulating valve requiring no auxiliary power, allowing the user to set the
temperature to their preferred set point. On hydronic and two-pipe steam systems, as the room temperature rises
the valve head expands, blocking the flow of hot water or steam into the radiator. On a one-pipe steam system the
TRVs are installed on the air vent and limit the amount of air escaping the radiator, which in turn limits the amount
of steam filling the radiator.
The current measure is limited to retrofit application in Multifamily buildings. TRVs are particularly effective in
large multifamily buildings where some rooms tend to be overheated resulting in tenants leaving windows open
even in winter.
From limited evaluation results, savings appear to be dependent on being part of a whole system commissioning
and balancing project.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF. If applied to other program
types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
To qualify for this measure the TRV is installed on an existing hydronic or steam heated radiator in a multifamily
building.

The expected measure life of a TRV is estimated as 15 years.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.3.20 Residential Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV)
Residential Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV)
D
Unconditioned outdoor air is typically warmer or cooler than desired by the occupants and is often also more
humid than desired. A Residential ERV system provides necessary outdoor air ventilation while preheating or
precooling the outdoor air, and, in some Residential ERV systems, pre-dehumidifying the outdoor air as well. This
saves energy required for heating, cooling, and dehumidifying the residence.
An ERV generally comprises two fans (Exhaust and Outdoor Intake) that pass the two streams of air through a heat
exchanger, which may be a fixed plate heat exchanger or a rotary heat recovery wheel. Sensible heat from the
warmer air stream is transferred to the cooler air stream, thereby reducing the amount of heating energy or
cooling energy needed to condition the outdoor air to desired indoor air temperature and humidity levels. The
heat exchanger surfaces, in some ERV models, may be coated with a hydroscopic material that absorbs/releases or
transfers latent moisture from one air stream to the other. This increases the overall energy transfer efficiency
during humid summer months by partially dehumidifying moist outdoor air using the relatively drier indoor
exhaust air. In the winter, this same effect serves to humidify the outdoor air, making the space more
comfortable, but not saving significant energy.
The current measure serves all residential single family and Group R2, R3 and R4 dwellings of 3 stories or less, both
existing and new, where ERV is not required to comply with energy code.
This measure was developed to be applicable to electric cooling systems and electric or natural gas heating

Daily_Hrs_Ventilation = Average annual daily ERV run time during which heat/cooling is being recovered,
based on the assumption that ERV is selected to provide adequate ventilation rate when
operated continuously on the coldest day of the year, when the defrost cycle interrupts
heat recovery for a period of time depending on outdoor air temperature. ERV is assumed
to be oversized so that on this coldest day, the ERV will provide the total ventilation air
quantity during the minutes that is is not in defrost. As an example, if a coldest day results
in 20% defrost time, the ERV is assumed to be selected at 1/0.8 or 125% oversizing. On
the coldest day, the fan would operate 100% of the time. When not in defrost, it is
assumed the homeowner would reduced fan operation to 80% runtime to avoid
overventilating the residence. This assumed behavior results in an average annual
runtime per day ranging from 17.8 to 18.9 hours/day.

ERV Fan Energy Savings
For all heating or heating/cooling ERV applications, the ERV fan savings represents the change in energy usage of
the ERV fan annual energy use versus the base case standard (non-ERV) exhaust fan energy use.
The base case non-ERV exhaust fan energy use is deemed to be equal to the average ERV daily exhaust volume of
air exhausted, times the deemed fan efficiency of a continuously-operated bathroom exhaust fan, as defined in
Section 5.3.9 of IL-TRM_Effective_010122_v10.0_Vol_3_Res_08062021_DRAFT.docx: 1.7 CFM/Watt. The daily
average total exhaust volume of the existing bathroom exhaust fan(s) is deemed to be equal to the proposed ERV
daily average total exhaust volume, after taking into account the defrost cycle periods wherein ERV fan energy is
consumed but no ventilation occurs.

Domestic Hot Water Pipe Insulation
D
This measure describes adding insulation to un-insulated domestic hot water pipes. The measure assumes the pipe
wrap is installed either to the first length of both the hot and cold pipe (this is the most cost-effective section to
insulate in non-circulating systems, since the water pipes act as an extension of the hot water tank) or to a hot water
recirculating loop. Insulating this length therefore helps reduce standby losses. Default savings are provided per 3ft
length and are appropriate up to 6ft of the hot water pipe and 3ft of the cold. Where a hot water recirculating pump
is in use, this measure is viable for the entire hot water loop.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, RF, KITS.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.

provided to allow savings to be calculated from any baseline condition.
b) Time of Sale:
• The installation of a domestic heat pump water heater in place of a standard electric or fossil fuel-
fired water heater in a home.
• Note that the baseline in this case is an equivalent replacement system to that which exists
currently in the home. Where unknown, the baseline can be assumed to be a 50 gallon electric
storage water heater with medium draw pattern.
c) Early Replacement
• The early removal of a functioning fossil-fuel fired water heater from service, prior to its natural
end of life, and replacement with a new domestic heat pump water heater.
• Note that the baseline in this case is the existing equipment being replaced. Savings are calculated
between the existing unit and efficient unit consumption during the remaining life of the existing
unit, and between a new equivalent replacement system to that which exists currently in the home
and efficient unit consumption for the remainder of the measure life.
Savings are presented dependent on the heating system installed in the home, presence of cooling, and presence of
dehumidification due to the impact of the heat pump water heater on the heating cooling and dehumidification
loads.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, ER.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
To qualify for this measure the installed equipment must be an ENERGY STAR Heat Pump domestic water heater.

The baseline condition is a new water heater meeting federal minimum efficiency standards, dependent on the
storage volume (in gallons) of the water heater.

The same draw pattern (very small, low, medium and high draw) should be used for both baseline and efficient units.
If using a deemed approach, for units ≤55 gallons – baseline is assumed to be a resistance storage unit with efficiency:
0.9307 – (0.0002 * rated volume in gallons) assuming medium draw.
For units >55 gallons – assume a 50 gallon resistance tank baseline; i.e., 0.9299 UEF assuming high draw .
If unknown, assume a 50 gallon resistance tank baseline, at medium draw, therefore 0.9207 UEF.

The expected measure life is assumed to be 15 years.
Note a mid-life adjustment to account for replacement of HVAC equipment during the measure life should be applied
after 10 years or 13 years for boilers. See section below for detail.

energy use at the customer’s meter (using ΔkWh algorithm below), customer switching estimates, NTG, and any
other adjustment factors deemed appropriate, should be used.
The inputs to cost effectiveness screening should reflect the actual impacts on the electric and fuel consumption at
the customer meter and, for fuel switching measures, should therefore reflect the decrease in one fuel and increase
in another, as opposed to the single savings value calculated in the “Electric and Fossil Fuel Energy Savings” section

Low Flow Faucet Aerators
D
This measure relates to the installation of a low flow faucet aerator in a household kitchen or bath faucet fixture.
This measure may be used for units provided through Efficiency Kits however the in service rate for such measures
should be derived through evaluation results specifically for this implementation methodology.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, RF, DI, KITS.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
To qualify for this measure the installed equipment must be a low flow faucet aerator, for bathrooms rated at 1.5
gallons per minute (GPM) or less, or for kitchens rated at 2.2 GPM or less. Savings are calculated on an average
savings per faucet fixture basis.
D B E
The baseline condition is assumed to be a standard bathroom faucet aerator rated at 2.2 GPM or greater, or a
standard kitchen faucet aerator rated at 2.2 GPM or greater.
Average measured flow rates are used in the algorithm and are lower, reflecting the penetration of previously
installed low flow fixtures (and therefore the freerider rate for this measure should be 0), use of the faucet at less
than full flow, debris buildup, and lower water system pressure than fixtures are rated at.
D L E E
The expected measure life is assumed to be 10 years.
D M C
For time of sale or new construction the incremental cost for this measure is $3, or program actual.
For faucet aerators provided through Direct Install or within Efficiency Kits, the actual program delivery costs
(including labor if applicable) should be utilized. If unknown, assume $8 for Direct Install and $3 for Efficiency Kits.

Low Flow Showerheads
D
This measure relates to the installation of a low flow showerhead in a single or multi-family household.
This measure may be used for units provided through Efficiency Kits; however the in service rate for such measures
should be derived through evaluation results specifically for this implementation methodology.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, RF, NC, DI, KITS.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
To qualify for this measure the installed equipment must be a low flow showerhead rated at least 0.5 gallons per
minute (GPM) less than the existing showerhead. Savings are calculated on a per showerhead fixture basis.
D B E
For Direct install programs, the baseline condition is assumed to be a standard showerhead rated at 2.0 GPM or
greater.
For retrofit and time-of-sale programs, the baseline condition is assumed to be a representative average of existing
showerhead flow rates of participating customers including a range of low flow showerheads, standard-flow
showerheads, and high-flow showerheads.
Average measured flow rates are used in the algorithm and are lower, reflecting the penetration of previously
installed low flow fixtures (and therefore the freerider rate for this measure should be 0), use of the shower at less
than full flow, debris buildup, and lower water system pressure than fixtures are rated at.
D L E E
The expected measure life is assumed to be 10 years.
D M C
For time of sale or new construction the incremental cost for this measure is $7 or program actual.
For low flow showerheads provided through Direct Install or within Efficiency Kits, the actual program delivery costs
(including labor if applicable) should be utilized. If unknown assume $12 for Direct Install and $7 for Efficiency
Kits.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.4.10 Pool Covers
Pool Covers
D
This measure refers to the installation of covers on residential use pools that are heated with gas-fired equipment
located either indoors or outdoors. By installing pool covers, the heating load on the pool boiler will be reduced by
reducing the heat loss from the water to the environment and the amount of actual water lost due to evaporation
(which then requires additional heated water to make up for it). An additional benefit to pool covers are the
electricity savings from the reduced fresh water required to replace the evaporated water.
The main source of energy loss in pools is through evaporation. This is particularly true of outdoor pools where wind
plays a larger role. The point of installing pool covers is threefold. First, it will reduce convective losses due to the
wind by shielding the water surface. Second, it will insulate the water from the colder surrounding air. And third, it
will reduce radiative losses to the night sky. In doing so, evaporative losses will also be minimized, and the boiler will
not need to work as hard in replenishing the pool with hot water to keep the desired temperature.
This measure can be used for pools that (1) currently do not have pool covers, (2) have pool covers that are past the
useful life of the existing cover, or (3) have pool covers that are past their warranty period and have failed.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program type: RF. If applied to other program types,
the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
For indoor pools, the efficient case is the installation of an indoor pool cover with a 5 year warranty on an indoor
pool that is used all year.
For outdoor pools, the efficient case is the installation of an outdoor pool cover with a 5 year warranty on an outdoor
pool that is used through the summer season.
D B E
For indoor pools, the base case is an uncovered indoor pool that operates all year.
For outdoor pools, the base case is an outdoor pool that is uncovered and is open through the summer season.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.4.11 Drain Water Heat Recovery
Drain Water Heat Recovery
D
Drain Water Heat Recovery (DWHR) is a technology that captures waste heat in the drain line during a shower
event, using the reclaimed heat to preheat cold water that is then delivered either to the shower or the water
heater. The device can be installed in either an equal flow configuration (with preheated water being routed to
both the water heater and the shower) or an unequal flow configuration (preheated water directed to either the
water heater or shower). The energy harvested from a DWHR device is maximized in an equal flow configuration. It
uses a non-regenerative heat exchanger to pre-heat the incoming cold fresh water with the outgoing warm drain
water. It has been proven that DWHR devices only recover energy during simultaneous draws, i.e., showers,
and that for energy savings purposes all other water draws can be ignored. Savings are calculated per drain water
heat recovery unit. Other benefits include increased first-hour rating of water tank, improved comfort due to
slower temperature degradation at run-out and reduction of coincident peak demand.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF, NC. If applied to other program
types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
Efficient equipment is a DWHR unit retrofitted to the main drain which includes outlets from showers, sinks and
other fixtures too. Note, that the DWHR unit can either be installed in a vertical configuration or a horizontal
configuration. Although, this measure covers both horizontal and vertical DWHR, the energy savings calculations
focuses on vertical. Due to the lack of any moving parts, no maintenance is required for either types of DWHR units.
Vertical units are said to comprise 95% of the market currently.
The device can be installed in either an equal flow configuration or an unequal flow configuration. An equal flow
installation is ideal with all the incoming cold water passing through the DWHR heat exchanger apparatus, after
which it splits into cold water and inlet to water heater. Units should be installed in single-family homes and multi-
family homes.

The baseline condition is a storage type water heater without DWHR devices in a residential application.

Demand control recirculation pumps seek to reduce inefficiency by combining control via temperature and demand
inputs, whereby the controller will not activate the recirculation pump unless both (a) the recirculation loop return
water has dropped below a prescribed temperature (e.g., 100°F) and (b) a CDHW demand is sensed as water flow
through the CDHW system.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, RF, NC. If applied to other
program types, the measure savings should be verified.

Re-circulating pump shall cycle on based on (a) the recirculation loop return water dropping below a prescribed
temperature (e.g. 100°F) and (b) a CDHW demand is sensed as water flow through the CDHW system.
There are three alternative technologies that are considered in this characterization:
• Timer-based. This technology allows the user to program a schedule to perform recirculation during specific
windows throughout the day.
• Aquastat-controlled. This type of control calls for recirculation when the water temperature at one point in
the system falls below a certain pre-programmed setpoint.
• On-Demand. This technology senses the demand as water flow through the CDHW system. These types of
system are most adequate on small central water heating systems.

5.5.6 LED Specialty Lamps
D
Please note that this measure characterization contains specific assumptions that were negotiated as a compromise
between the utilities and stakeholders and also reflects input from community-based organizations. The
compromise is designed to allow for a gradual change in lncome Qualified programming and to address the unique
challenges that an abrupt change makes within the context of the Illinois CPAS savings goal structure. Such
compromise shall not be taken as precedent for future non-consensus discussions.
This measure describes savings from a variety of specialty LED lamp types (including globe, decorative and
downlights). This characterization assumes that the LED lamp is installed in a residential location. Where the
implementation strategy does not allow for the installation location to be known (e.g., an upstream retail program
not in a store ‘easily accessed by income qualified communities’ (see discussion below)) a deemed split of 96%
Residential and 4% Commercial assumptions should be used. For stores easily accessed by income qualified
communities, 100% of sales are assumed to be Income Qualified (IQ) residential.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, EREP, KITS.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
To qualify for this measure the installed equipment must be an ENERGY STAR LED lamp or fixture or equivalent to
the most recent version of ENERGY STAR specifications. Note a new ENERGY STAR specification v2.1 becomes
effective on 1/2/2017.
D B E
Specialty and Directional lamps were not included in the original definition of General Service Lamps in the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). Therefore, the initial baseline is an incandescent / halogen lamp
described in the table below.
A DOE Final Rule released on 1/19/2017 updated the EISA regulations to remove the exemption for these lamp types
such that they become subject to the backstop provision defined within the original legislation. In September 2019
this decision was revoked in a new DOE Final Rule. However, in May 2022 DOE reversed this decision by issuing a
Final rule for both the broadened General Service Lamp definition as well as the implementation of the 45 lumen
per watt backstop. DOE stated that it will use its enforcement discretion to minimize impacts on the supply chain
and effectively allow companies to continue the manufacture and import of noncompliant bulbs through the
remainder of 2022, and allow retailers to continue selling them with limited enforcement until July 2023.
Non-Income Qualified Programs
This TRM assumes that non-income qualified participants would continue to have access to baseline / noncompliant
bulbs through retail until 6/30/2023 after which the baseline for new purchases becomes an LED (since only CFL and
LED are able to meet the 45 lu/watt standard and CFLs now make up <1% of the market). For purchases made before
this date it is assumed that stockpiles would remain through the remainder of 2023 such that the measure life for
2023 purchases is reduced to 2 years.
Direct Install programs where it can be shown that the LED is replacing working inefficient lighting should continue
to use the existing inefficient lighting as baseline and also assume a measure life of 2 years.
Income Qualified Programs
Through 2025, Retail programs in stores ‘easily accessed by income qualified communities’ (as defined below), and
2023 IL TRM v11.0 Vol. 3_September 22, 2022_FINAL Page 311 of 479
Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.5.6 LED Specialty Lamps
Kit, School and Foodbank programs, will continue to assume a halogen baseline and apply a measure life of 8 years.
A store is considered easily accessed by income qualified communities :
a. For Ameren:
i. if it is a retail store that is closest to a community with a zip code that has 65% of family
households with an income less than or equal to 299% of the Federal poverty level for
their household size (Applies to big box (e.g., Walmart), club (e.g., Costco), DIY (e.g.,
Home Depot), hardware and grocery stores); or
ii. If it is a "dollar store" in the AIC service area; or
iii. If it is a "thrift store" in the AIC service area.
b. For ComEd:
i. if it is a retail store is within a zip code where at least 60% or more of the households
are at or below 80% Area Median Income (AMI); or
ii. If it is a "dollar store" in the ComEd service area; or
iii. If it is a "thrift store" in the ComEd service area.
100% of sales from such stores as defined above will count as IQ lighting.
Direct Install programs where it can be shown that the LED is replacing working inefficient lighting should continue
to use the existing inefficient lighting as baseline and also assume a measure life of 8 years.
New Construction Programs
Since IECC 2015 energy code, there has been mandatory requirements for lighting in New Construction: “Not less
than 75 percent (90 percent in IECC 2018 and 100 percent in IECC 2021) of the lamps in permanently installed lighting
fixtures shall be high-efficacy lamps or not less than 75 percent (90 percent in IECC 2018 and 100 percent in IECC
2021) of the permanently installed lighting fixtures shall contain only high-efficacy lamps”. To meet the ‘high efficacy’
requirements, lamps need to be CFL or LED, however since CFLs are no longer commonly purchased (only 1%
baseline forecast) it is assumed that 75% (IECC 2015) or 90% (IECC 2018) or 100% (IECC 2021) of the New
Construction baseline is an LED and therefore savings are reduced by that percentage for bulbs provided in New
Construction projects. Any New Construction project utilitizing IECC 2021 code should therefore not include savings
from this measure.
D L E E
The average rated life for Decorative lamps on the ENERGY STAR Qualified Products list (accessed 6/16/2020) is
approximately 17,000 hours, and for Directional Lamps is approximately 25,000 hours.
However, for all purchases through 2025 the measure life is assumed to be two years for non-income eligible
populations and eight years for income eligible populations.

This measure characterizes the savings associated with installing a Light Emitting Diode (LED) exit sign in place of a
fluorescent or incandescent exit sign in a Multifamily building within unit (use 4.5.5 Commercial Exit Signs for
multifamily common area exit signs). Light Emitting Diode exit signs have a string of very small, typically red or green,
glowing LEDs arranged in a circle or oval. The LEDs may also be arranged in a line on the side, top or bottom of the
exit sign. LED exit signs provide the best balance of safety, low maintenance, and very low energy usage compared

Please note that this measure characterization contains specific assumptions that were negotiated as a compromise
between the utilities and stakeholders and also reflects input from community-based organizations. The
compromise is designed to allow for a gradual change in lncome Qualified programming and to address the unique
challenges that an abrupt change makes within the context of the Illinois CPAS savings goal structure. Such
compromise shall not be taken as precedent for future non-consensus discussions.
This characterization provides savings assumptions for LED Screw Based Omnidirectional (e.g., A-Type lamps) lamps
within the residential and multifamily sectors. This characterization assumes that the LED lamp is installed in a
residential location. Where the implementation strategy does not allow for the installation location to be known
(e.g., an upstream retail program not in a store ‘easily accessed by income qualified communities’ (see discussion
below)) a deemed split of 97% Residential and 3% Commercial assumptions should be used. For stores easily
accessed by income qualified communities, 100% of sales are assumed to be Income Qualified (IQ) residential.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, EREP, DI, KITS.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
In order for this characterization to apply, new lamps must be ENERGY STAR labeled or equivalent to the most
recent version of ENERGY STAR specifications. Note a new ENERGY STAR specification v2.1 became effective on
1/2/2017.
D B E
In 2012, Federal legislation stemming from the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) will require all
general-purpose light bulbs between 40 watts and 100 watts to have ~30% increased efficiency, essentially phasing
out standard incandescent technology. In 2012, the 100 w lamp standards apply; in 2013 the 75 w lamp standards
will apply, followed by restrictions on the 60 w and 40 w lamps in 2014. Since measures installed under this TRM all
occur after 2014, baseline equipment are the values after EISA. These are shown in the baseline table below.
Additionally, an EISA backstop provision was included that would require replacement baseline lamps to meet an
efficacy requirement of 45 lumens/watt or higher beginning on 1/1/2020. In December 2019, DOE issued a final
determination for General Service Incandescent Lamps (GSILs), finding that this more stringent standard was not
economically justified. However, in May 2022 DOE reversed this decision by issuing a Final rule for both the
broadened General Service Lamp definition as well as the implementation of the 45 lumen per watt backstop. DOE
stated that it will use its enforcement discretion to minimize impacts on the supply chain and effectively allow
companies to continue the manufacture and import of noncompliant bulbs through the remainder of 2022, and
allow retailers to continue selling them with limited enforcement until July 2023.

Income Qualified Programs
Through 2025, Retail programs in stores ‘easily accessed by income qualified communities’ (as defined below), and
Kit, School and Foodbank programs, will continue to assume a halogen baseline and apply a measure life of 8 years.
A store is considered easily accessed by income qualified communities :

ii. If it is a "dollar store" in the ComEd service area; or
iii. If it is a "thrift store" in the ComEd service area.
100% of sales from such stores as defined above will count as IQ lighting.
Direct Install programs where it can be shown that the LED is replacing working inefficient lighting should continue
to use the existing inefficient lighting as baseline and also assume a measure life of 8 years.
New Construction Programs
Since IECC 2015 energy code, there has been mandatory requirements for lighting in New Construction: “Not less
than 75 percent (90 percent in IECC 2018 and 100 percent in IECC 2021) of the lamps in permanently installed lighting
fixtures shall be high-efficacy lamps or not less than 75 percent (90 percent in IECC 2018 and 100 percent in IECC
2021) of the permanently installed lighting fixtures shall contain only high-efficacy lamps”. To meet the ‘high efficacy’
requirements, lamps need to be CFL or LED, however since CFLs are no longer commonly purchased (only 1%
baseline forecast) it is assumed that 75% (IECC 2015) or 90% (IECC 2018) or 100% (IECC 2021) of the New
Construction baseline is an LED and therefore savings are reduced by that percentage for bulbs provided in New
Construction projects. Any New Construction project utilizing IECC 2021 code should therefore not include savings
from this measure.

The average rated life for Omnidirectional lamps on the ENERGY STAR Qualified Products list (accessed 6/16/2020)
is approximately 20,000 hours.
However, for all purchases through 2025 the measure life is assumed to be two years for non-income eligible

Please note that this measure characterization contains specific assumptions that were negotiated as a compromise
between the utilities and stakeholders and also reflects input from community-based organizations. The
compromise is designed to allow for a gradual change in lncome Qualified programming and to address the unique
challenges that an abrupt change makes within the context of the Illinois CPAS savings goal structure. Such
compromise shall not be taken as precedent for future non-consensus discussions.
This characterization provides savings assumptions for LED Fixtures and is broken into five ENERGY STAR fixture
types: Indoor Fixtures (including track lighting, wall-wash, sconces, ceiling and fan lights), Task and Downlight Under
Cabinet Fixtures (linear under cabinet fixtures are exempt from EISA and so can be found in measure 5.5.13),
Outdoor Fixtures (including flood light, hanging lights, security/path lights, outdoor porch lights), and Downlight
Fixtures.
Where the implementation strategy does not allow for the installation location to be known (e.g., an upstream retail
program not in a store ‘easily accessed by income qualified communities’ (see discussion below)) utilities should
develop an assumption of the residential v commercial split and apply the relevant assumptions to each portion. A
default deemed split of 97% Residential and 3% Commercial assumptions can be used based on Omnidirectional
Bulbs. For stores easily accessed by income qualified communities, 100% of sales are assumed to be Income
Qualified (IQ) residential.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
In order for this characterization to apply, new fixtures must be ENERGY STAR labeled based upon the v2.1 ENERGY
STAR specification for luminaires or equivalent to the most recent version of ENERGY STAR specifications.
Specifications are as follows:
table is here
D B E
The baseline condition for this measure is assumed to be an average of EISA-equivalent wattages for ENERGY STAR-
qualified products. Most of the lamp types in this measure are considered specialty so the baseline adjustments are
consistent with the 5.5.6 LED Specialty Lamps.
Specialty and Directional lamps were not included in the original definition of General Service Lamps in the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). Therefore, the initial baseline is an incandescent / halogen lamp
described in the tables below.
A DOE Final Rule released on 1/19/2017 updated the EISA regulations to remove the exemption for these lamp types
such that they become subject to the backstop provision defined within the original legislation. In September 2019
this decision was revoked in a DOE Final Rule. However, in May 2022 DOE reversed this decision by issuing a Final
rule for both the broadened General Service Lamp definition as well as the implementation of the 45 lumen per watt
backstop. DOE stated that it will use its enforcement discretion to minimize impacts on the supply chain and

effectively allow companies to continue the manufacture and import of noncompliant bulbs through the remainder
of 2022, and allow retailers to continue selling them with limited enforcement until July 2023.
Non-Income Qualified Programs
This TRM assumes that non-income qualified participants would continue to have access to baseline / noncompliant
bulbs through retail until 6/30/2023 after which the baseline for new purchases becomes an LED (since only CFL and
LED are able to meet the 45 lu/watt standard and CFLs now make up <1% of the market). For purchases made before
this date it is assumed that stockpiles would remain through the remainder of 2023 such that the measure life for
2023 purchases is reduced to 2 years.
Direct Install programs where it can be shown that the LED is replacing working inefficient lighting should continue
to use the existing inefficient lighting as baseline and also assume a measure life of 2 years.
Income Qualified Programs
Through 2025, Retail programs in stores ‘easily accessed by income qualified communities’ (as defined below), and
Kit, School and Foodbank programs, will continue to assume a halogen baseline and apply a measure life of 8 years.
A store is considered easily accessed by income qualified communities :
a. For Ameren:
iv. if it is a retail store that is closest to a community with a zip code that has 65% of family
households with an income less than or equal to 299% of the Federal poverty level for
their household size (Applies to big box (e.g., Walmart), club (e.g., Costco), DIY (e.g.,
Home Depot), hardware and grocery stores); or
v. If it is a "dollar store" in the AIC service area; or
vi. If it is a "thrift store" in the AIC service area.
b. For ComEd:
vii. if it is a retail store is within a zip code where at least 60% or more of the households
are at or below 80% Area Median Income (AMI); or
viii. If it is a "dollar store" in the ComEd service area; or
ix. If it is a "thrift store" in the ComEd service area.
100% of sales from such stores as defined above will count as IQ lighting.
Direct Install programs where it can be shown that the LED is replacing working inefficient lighting should continue
to use the existing inefficient lighting as baseline and also assume a measure life of 8 years.
New Construction Programs
Since IECC 2015 energy code, there has been mandatory requirements for lighting in New Construction: “Not less
than 75 percent (90 percent in IECC 2018 and 100 percent in IECC 2021) of the lamps in permanently installed lighting
fixtures shall be high-efficacy lamps or not less than 75 percent (90 percent in IECC 2018 and 100 percent in IECC
2021) of the permanently installed lighting fixtures shall contain only high-efficacy lamps”. To meet the ‘high efficacy’
requirements, lamps need to be CFL or LED, however since CFLs are no longer commonly purchased (only 1%
baseline forecast) it is assumed that 75% (IECC 2015) or 90% (IECC 2018) or 100% (IECC 2021) of the New
Construction baseline is an LED and therefore savings are reduced by that percentage for bulbs provided in New
Construction projects. Any New Construction project utilizing IECC 2021 code should therefore not include savings
from this measure.

Holiday String Lighting
D
This measure categorizes the savings from customers handing in incandescent string lighting typically used during
the holidays and receiving equivalent LED string lighting. LED bulbs on string lights can consume up to 98% less power
when compared to incandescent bulbs. Besides less energy to operate, LED string lighting offers many other
advantages over incandescent: longer bulb life, a higher brightness, less heat buildup making them safer especially
when used indoors on live trees, and better durability since they use a plastic covering over the diode instead of a
glass bulb.
This measure applies to mini, C7, and C9 bulb shape types used in residential locations. Description of the bulb types
of string lighting are listed below: ,
Mini: About 1/4” wide x 5/8” high with a shape described as a miniature candle with a pointed tip.
The mini is the most common type of string light today and shares about 80% of the market.
They have a female-to-male push type base.
C7: Approximately 1” wide x 1-1/2” high with a shape described as a strawberry. The C7 (and C9) are
thought of as more “old fashioned” or traditional since they were the first types of string lighting
used for decorative purposes. The C7 shares about 7% of the market and has a screw-in E12
candelabra base.
C9: Similar in shape to the C7, the C9 is slightly larger at 1-1/4” wide x 2-1/2” high. The C9 shares
about 5% of the market and has a screw-in E17 intermediate base.
A third variant of the “C” bulb exists, which is called C6. However, due to lack of availability of the C6 incandescent
from retailers, it is assumed the market has already adopted the LED as the baseline for this bulb shape type and
should not be claimed for utility program savings.
The implementation strategy for this measure is only geared towards residential customers. Furthermore, the
deemed hours of operation are sourced on residential only. As such, the proposed deemed split of 100% Residential
and 0% Commercial assumptions should be used.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: EREP. To ensure that the baseline is
appropriate, the measure is limited to an exchange event where the customer has to turn in a string of inefficient
lighting.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
To qualify for this measure, new string lights must be LED and one of the eligible bulb shape categories listed in this
measure (mini, C7, C9).
Some manufacturers offer integrated “smart” control of new LED strings; however, these are not included in this
measure.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.5.12 Connected LED Lamps
Connected LED Lamps
D
Many home devices in the market have become integrated with smart technology in recent years. Home devices
able to connect to Wifi or a mobile network allow the user to control the device over the internet. This measure
defines the savings associated with connected lighting. Connected LEDs allow for remote user control through a
smart device, such as smart phone, tablet, or smart speaker. The standard LED provides light in one shade at one
lumen level and color temperature. Connected LEDs have options integrated that allow for customizable color, color
temperature, and lumen output. The Connected LED can also be turned on and off with a set schedule or controlled
remotely. Savings from this measure come from both reduced hours of operation and dimming.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC
D E E
For this characterization to apply, the efficient condition must be LED lighting that is controlled by a smart device.
The savings for this measure are the estimated incremental control savings compared to a non-connected efficient
lamp. Some connected LEDs come with hubs for managing their operations. Connected LEDs with hubs do not qualify
for this savings characterization, as the energy use by the hub cancels out the savings attributed to the connectivity
of the lamp.
D B E
The baseline condition is the efficient LED without the connected capabilities.
D L E E
The deemed measure life is 6.1 years for exterior application. For all other applications, lifetimes are capped at
10 years.

The incremental cost can be assumed to be $20, the difference between the average cost of the baseline non-
connected LED and the average cost of the connected LED.

EISA Exempt LED Lighting
D
This characterization provides savings assumptions for LED lamps and fixture types that are exempt from the EISA
legislation. This characterization assumes that the LED lamp is installed in a residential location. Where the
implementation strategy does not allow for the installation location to be known (e.g., an upstream retail program)
a deemed split of 97% Residential and 3% Commercial assumptions should be used.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, EREP, DI, KITS.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
In order for this characterization to apply, new lamps must be ENERGY STAR labeled or equivalent to the most
recent version of ENERGY STAR specifications or be listed on the Design Lights Consortium Qualifying Product List.
Note a new ENERGY STAR specification v2.1 became effective on 1/2/2017.
D B E
This measure is only for lamp and fixture types that are exempt from EISA, including lamps with an initial lumen
output of less than 310 lumens, with initial lumen output greater than 3,300 lumens, and Task/Undercabinet Fixtures
with a linear fluorescent baseline.
D L E E
The average rated life for Omnidirectional lamps on the ENERGY STAR Qualified Products list (accessed 6/16/2020)
is approximately 20,000 hours. The deemed measure life is 8 years for exterior application and lifetimes are capped
at 10 years for other applications. For early replacement measures, if replacing a halogen or incandescent bulb,
the remaining life is assumed to be 333 hours. For CFL’s, the remaining life is 3,333 hours.
The rated life of linear task and under cabinet fixtures is 45,000 hours and for T-LEDS is 50,000 hours. However,
all fixture lifetimes are capped at 15 years.

For Linear Task/Under Cabinet and T-LEDs, with a linear fluorescent baseline, there is assumed no O&M impact
since the baseline lamp life is 18,000 – 30,000 hours and which is longer than the assumed measure life.
It is important to note that for cost-effectiveness screening purposes, the O&M cost adjustments should only be

Air Sealing
D
Thermal shell air leaks are sealed through strategic use and location of air-tight materials. Leaks are detected and
leakage rates measured with the assistance of a blower-door. The algorithm for this measure can be used when the
program implementation does not allow for more detailed forecasting through the use of residential modeling
software. Prescriptive savings are provided for use only when a blower door test is not conducted.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
Air sealing materials and diagnostic testing should meet all eligibility program qualification criteria. The initial and
final tested leakage rates should be performed in such a manner that the identified reductions can be properly
discerned, particularly in situations wherein multiple building envelope measures may be implemented
simultaneously.
D B E
The existing air leakage should be determined through approved and appropriate test methods using a blower door.
The baseline condition of a building upon first inspection significantly impacts the opportunity for cost-effective
energy savings through air-sealing. Savings are provided for prescriptive air sealing measures when a blower door
test is not conducted.
D L E E
The expected measure life is assumed to be 20 years.
The expected measure life of prescriptive shrink-fit window film is assumed to be 1 year.
Note a mid-life adjustment to account for replacement of HVAC equipment during the measure life should be applied

Insulation is added to a basement or crawl space. Insulation added above ground in conditioned space is modeled
the same as wall insulation. Below ground insulation is adjusted with an approximation of the thermal resistance of
the ground. Insulation in unconditioned spaces is modeled by reducing the degree days to reflect the smaller but
non-zero contribution to heating and cooling load. Cooling savings only consider above grade insulation, as below
grade has little temperature difference during the cooling season.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF.

Floor Insulation Above Crawlspace
D
Insulation is added to the floor above a vented crawl space that does not contain pipes or HVAC equipment. If there
are pipes, HVAC, or a basement, it is desirable to keep them within the conditioned space by insulating the crawl
space walls and ground. Insulating the floor separates the conditioned space above from the space below the floor,
and is only acceptable when there is nothing underneath that could freeze or would operate less efficiently in an
environment resembling the outdoors. Even in the case of an empty, unvented crawl space, it is still considered best
practice to seal and insulate the crawl space perimeter rather than the floor. Not only is there generally less area to
insulate this way, but there are also moisture control benefits. There is a “Basement Insulation” measure for
perimeter sealing and insulation. This measure assumes the insulation is installed above an unvented crawl space
and should not be used in other situations.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF.

Rim/Band Joist Insulation
D
This measure describes savings from adding insulation (either rigid or spray foam) to rim/band joist cavities. This
measure requires a member of the implementation staff evaluating the pre- and post-project R-values and to
measure surface areas. The efficiency of the heating and cooling equipment in the home should also be evaluated if
possible.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
This measure requires a member of the implementation staff or a participating contractor to evaluate the pre and
post R-values and measure surface areas. The requirements for participation in the program will be defined by the
utilities.
D B E
The existing condition will be evaluated by implementation staff or a participating contractor and is likely to be
empty wall cavities and little or no attic insulation.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.6.7 Low-E Storm Window
Low-E Storm Window
D
Emissivity is a measure of thermal radiation emitted by an object’s surface. Emissivity values range from 0 to 1 with
1 being the emissivity of a black body. Low emissivity (low-e) storm window inserts reduce the rate of thermal
radiation of the window assembly through the interaction of multiple properties. The low-e surface of the insert
means that the window will transfer heat at a reduced rate. The newly created air gap between the window and the
insert combined with the low emissivity of the insert improves thermal performance of the window assembly. The
inserts include weather-stripping as a means of sealing the connection which reduces air infiltration. This measure
offers benefits during both heating and cooling seasons, for both natural gas and electricity. In addition to energy
benefits, this measure offers non-energy benefits including increased comfort and noise reduction.
The calculation of savings presented in this section apply to single and multifamily residential applications with no
portable window air conditioners. Small commercial applications with operating characteristics similar to a
residential profile are also eligible for the savings presented here.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF, DI. If applied to other program
types, the measure savings should be verified.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.6.8 Triple Pane and Thin Triple Windows
Triple Pane and Thin Triple Windows
D
Conventional triple pane windows and thin triple windows (TTW) greatly improve building thermal envelope
performance compared to code standard double-glazed windows. High performance windows must achieve a U-
value ≤ 0.20 (R5) to meet the criteria of this measure marking a significant improvement from Illinois’ most stringent
climate zone, which requires a U-value ≤ 0.30 (R-3.3). High performance windows significantly decrease heat loss
through the buildings envelope by adding a third pane of glass in the insulating glass unit (IGU). This provides an
additional surface to include another low-E coating and increases resistance to heat loss by improving the insulating
capability of the window.
The window’s reduced heat loss has a significant impact on home energy savings as windows are often the weakest
part of any building envelope. In addition to reducing heat loss, TTW also reduce air infiltration contributing to
decreased HVAC loads. These products provide benefits for both heating and cooling seasongs and for both natural
gas and electric heated and cooled homes. They also have non-energy benefits such as, increased thermal comfort
and decreased outside noise.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: NC, TOS, EREP. If applied to other
program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
Window containing triple-pane IGU that meets the performance specifications below
table is here
• Thin Triple Windows (TTW) – the insulating glass unit (IGU) contains three panes of glass - a thin pane of
center glass allows the IGU to fit within a standard window frame, eliminating the need to redesign the
window. The inclusion of a thin pane of center glass allows for an additional surface for low-E coating,
reducing the windows emissivity of thermal radiation and the rate of heat transfer by improving the U-value
of the IGU and overall assembly. Thin triple windows will have two equal width panes of glass on the exterior
of the IGU and a thin center piece of glass that allows the IGU to fit within an existing double-pane window
frame.
• Triple Pane Windows – conventional triple pane windows contain three panes of standard thickness glass.
These windows provide an additional surface for a low-e coating and provide improved thermal
performance by decreasing the windows emissivity and improving the window’s resistance to heat loss.
These windows are typically heavier than double-pane or TTW and require a redesign of the window to
allow the heavier, wider IGU to fit within the window frame.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.6.9 Insulated Cellular Shades
Insulated Cellular Shades
D
Insulating cellular shades greatly improve the thermal envelope performance compared to uncovered windows or
conventional vinyl window coverings. These coverings have a honeycomb or cellular structure that can be operated
manually or automated. Insulated cellular shades are considered to have the highest R-value among available blinds,
shades, and other window coverings. They are designed with multiple layers of varying fabrics to trap air inside
pockets that act as insulators and increase the R-value of the window covering and reduce the thermal heat transfer
through windows.
The window’s reduced heat loss has a significant impact on home energy savings as windows are often the weakest
part of any building envelope. These products provide benefits for both heating and cooling seasons and for both
natural gas and electric heated and cooled homes. They also have non-energy benefits such as, increased thermal
comfort and decreased outside noise.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC. If applied to other program
types, the measure savings should be verified
D E E
The efficient insulating cellular shades must be at least a double cell design installed on at least 75% of a home’s
windows. The Attachments Energy Rating Council (AERC) has a third party verified rating that has been developed
for residential window attachments . If possible, utilizing the AERC rating system, eligible insulating cellular
shades need to have a Cool Climate Rating greater or equal to 10 due to the Illinois climate.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.6.10 Multifamily Whole Building Aerosol Sealing
Multifamily Whole Building Aerosol Sealing
D
Multifamily buildings have many of the same leakage paths as single-family homes, as well as additional paths hidden
in shared walls or other cavities that are difficult to seal with conventional methods. Typically, shared walls between
multifamily homes are difficult to air seal effectively, leading to issues when trying to meet code. This measure is the
application of an aerosol sealant to a new or existing multifamily building. The aerosol envelope sealing technology
uses an automated approach to produce extremely tight envelopes.
Air is blown into a multifamily unit while an aerosol sealant “fog” is released in the interior. As air escapes the
building through leaks in the envelope, the sealant particles are carried to the leaks where they impact and stick to
the edges of the leaks, eventually sealing them. A standard house or duct air leakage test fan is used to pressurize
the building and provide real-time feedback and a permanent record of the sealing. The process is more effective
and convenient than conventional sealing methods because it requires less time and effort, it can seal a larger
portion of a leakage area more quickly, and can be used to meet more stringent compartmentalization requirements.
It can be used to seal multiple units in a residential multi-family building in a cost-effective manner. Energy savings
are estimated using EnergyPlus whole-building energy simulations.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF and NC. If applied to other program
types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
Existing multifamily units which have been aerosol sealed that meet an air exchange rate of 3.0 ACH50 (air changes
per hour) or lower. This meets the residential energy code tightness requirements . New multifamily units which
have been aerosol sealed that meet an air exchange rate of 0.6 ACH50 (air changes per hour) or lower. This meets
the Passive House tightness requirements.
D B E
Existing multifamily buildings that are undergoing a major envelope retrofit. The existing air leakage should be
determined through approved and appropriate test methods using a blower door at 50 Pascals. Note that setting up
a blower door is a required step in the aerosol sealing process.
The baseline for new construction buildings would be the applicable code for air exchange rate.

The expected measure life is assumed to be 20 years.

Energy savings are estimated using EnergyPlus whole-building energy simulations.
It is important to note that the energy savings for multifamily whole-building sealing process cannot be estimated
using a simple infiltration algorithm. This is because conversion of the measured building leakage (ACH50) to
infiltration at natural conditions treats the entire building as a single zone and does not account for air movement
between zones and housing units and also does not consider effects of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, whole
building level energy modeling must be done to estimate energy savings.
Baseline and efficient energy models were developed in the referenced study for Minneapolis climate zone. The
energy savings in this measure have been adjusted for the Illinois climate zones based on degree days. A
multifamily building with six floors was modeled containing four housing units in each floor. Each modeled unit is 30
ft wide and 40 ft long with a floor area of 1,200 ft . The floor plan is the same for each of the six floors in the modeled
building and is symmetric to minimize the effects of building orientation on the simulation results.
The heating system consists of a central boiler that served each apartment through terminal units. The boiler system
is rated for 75% seasonal efficiency. Cooling is provided by window air conditioners. The independent variables
include the building’s physical characteristics and operating parameters of the ventilation systems. The dependent
variables include building energy use, total outside air flow (e.g. infiltration and ventilation), and inter-zonal air flows
(e.g. adjoining units and units to/from common spaces).
E E S
There is minimal impact on the cooling energy savings. There is a slight increase in the cooling energy needed
after sealing due to less infiltration to offset internal loads. Due to the relatively small impact on cooling, it is not
considered to be significant.
S C P D S

N G S
The natural gas space heating savings are dependent on the ventilation system and whether the multifamily unit is
existing or new construction.
Four types of continuous ventilation schemes were modeled for the apartments.
a) Exhaust Only: Exhaust fan in each unit with no direct supply of outdoor air. Consists of a single fan
connected to a centrally located, single exhaust point in the house.
b) Exhaust and Half Supply: Ventilation scheme having both exhaust and supply ventilation systems. Full
capacity exhaust fan in each unit with supply ventilation to the unit that is approximately half the exhaust
capacity.
c) Balanced: A balanced ventilation system that has two fans and two duct systems. They introduce and
exhaust approximately equal quantities of fresh outside air and polluted inside air.

Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.6.10 Multifamily Whole Building Aerosol Sealing
d) No Ventilation: No continuous or intermittent mechanical ventilation. This is the most common type of
ventilation scheme in existing multifamily buildings.
Natural Gas savings for each ventilation type normalized per multifamily unit are listed in the below tables by climate
zone. The air exchange rate baseline for the New Building energy simulations was 3.0ACH50 and the measure case
was 0.6ACH50; whereas the baseline for the existing building energy simulations was 9.5ACH50 and the measure
case was 3.0ACH50 .

5.7 Miscellaneous
High Efficiency Pool Pumps
D
Residential outdoor pool pumps can be single speed, two/multi speed or variable speed. A federal standard (82 FR
5650) effective July 19, 2021 effectively requires new pumps to be at least two speed.
Single speed pumps are often oversized, and run frequently at constant flow regardless of load. Single speed pool
pumps require that the motor be sized for the task that requires the highest speed. As such, energy is wasted
performing low speed tasks at high speed. Two speed and variable speed pool pumps reduce speed when less flow
is required, such as when filtering is needed but not cleaning, and have timers that encourage programming for
fewer on-hours. Variable speed pool pumps use advanced motor technologies to achieve efficiency ratings of 90%
while the average single speed pump will have efficiency ratings between 30% and 70%.
This measure is the characterization of the purchasing and installing of a new ENERGY STAR or CEE T1 variable speed
residential pool pump motor in place of a new baseline pump meeting the federal standard for Time of Sale and
New Construction, or the early replacement of a standard single speed motor of equivalent horsepower.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, RF.
If applied to other program types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
The high efficiency equipment is an ENERGY STAR or CEE Tier residential pool pump meeting the ENERGY STAR
minimum qualifications for either in-ground or above ground pools. ENERGY STAR version 3.0 specification takes
effect on July 19, 2021. Note that for in ground pools, the CEE T1 level is the same as the new Federal Standard, and
Tier 2 is the same as ENERGY STAR V3 for the standard size pumps, so savings for CEE T1 is only provided for above
ground pools where there is an increment in efficiency.

Heat Pump Swimming Pool Heater
D
This measure is applicable to electric heat pump pool heaters in residential applications. Heat pumps capture heat
and move it from one place to another. The saving equations presented herein comprise three aspects of pool
heating: convective heat loss via pool surface area due to water and air temperature differential, initial heat of full
pool volume for seasonal pool use and reheat of pool refill on year round pools, and the heating of added pool water
to offset water loss through evaporation. This measure applies to replacing either a gas-fired pool heater or a an
electric resistance pool heater. If baseline equipment is a gas-fired pool heater, electric energy impacts result in
additional electrical usage, but lower overall site energy usage.
This measure is only applicable to inground or outdoor single family home pools and is not applicable to spas. This
measure is not applicable to community pools in multifamily housing complexes.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: TOS, NC, EREP.

Tree Planting
D
This measure describes savings from a program where utility sponsored staff work with homeowners or building
operators to determine the appropriate location and ultimately plant trees to maximize HVAC savings.
How measure saves energy:
1. Trees when in full foliage block direct sunlight onto exterior surfaces of residences, and in the cooling season
reduce energy use. Primary effects are reduced insulation into residences through windows. Secondary
effects are reduced wall and roof temperatures which reduce conduction through walls and roofs into
residences.
2. Trees when in full foliage block winds and associated infiltration into residences. This saves both heating
and cooling energy since outdoor air is generally either hotter or colder than the desired indoor
temperature.
3. Because trees have differential winter impacts, based on whether they are leaf-retaining (Coniferous) or
leaf-shedding (Deciduous), there are significantly differential effects of tree types for each facing wall of a
residence. Therefore, eligibility requirements for types of trees planted on specific residence wall faces
have been set to maximize savings and minimize losses due to trees.
4. Trees must provide shading to at least the 3rd story of a home in the cooling season and eligibility therefore
requires trees to be a minimum of 30 feet tall when fully mature.
Markets measure serves:
This measure provides benefits to single-family residences as well as multi-family residences. It provides benefits
for all types of homes, from 1 story to 3 story residences. Trees must be planted within 15 feet of the walls of homes
so that they provide shading during summer days when the sun is at a high angle.
Limitations to measure applicability:
This measure is inapplicable to residences that currently have trees shading the face where the trees are proposed
to be added (that is, the face of the existing residence where the tree is proposed must currently be unshaded).
Coniferous trees are ineligible on the East and South faces of residences because these trees block beneficial sunlight
in the heating season, which reduces annual savings severely. Similarly, Deciduous trees are ineligible on North faces
of residences because they lose their leaves in winter and therefore have a minimal wind-blocking effect on
infiltration during prevailing NW and W winter winds; in addition, because they are on the North face, they provide
attenuated benefits for summer cooling energy use.
This measure was developed to be applicable to the following program types: RF, NC. If applied to other program
types, the measure savings should be verified.
D E E
Trees must be horticulturally defined as either leaf-retaining (e.g., Coniferous) or leaf-shedding (e.g., Deciduous).
The eligibility of tree types are dependent on the orientation of the wall of the residence being shaded as follows:
1. On North-facing walls, only Coniferous trees (i.e., trees that retain leaves all year) are eligible.
2. On East- and South-facing walls, only Deciduous trees (i.e., trees that lose all leaves in Fall) are eligible.
3. On West-facing walls, both deciduous and coniferous trees are eligible.
4. Trees must be minimum 30 ft tall when fully mature and have a lifetime of at least 20 years in Midwest
climate.
5. Trees must be planted within 15 feet of the wall that they are shading and no closer than 20 feet apart.
D B E
Residence wall where trees are proposed to be planted currently must be fully or partially unshaded OR currently
2023 IL TRM v11.0 Vol. 3_September 22, 2022_FINAL Page 469 of 479
Illinois Statewide Technical Reference Manual — 5.7.5 Tree Planting
be planted with “ineligible” trees that will be removed and replaced with “eligible” trees. If the residence wall
currently is partially shaded, the proposed tree must be planted in front of the currently unshaded portion of the
wall.
D L E E
Savings from tree planting take a number of years to be realized as significant growth is required before the shading
makes a significant impact. The length of time before savings are fully achieved will be dependent on a number of
factors including size of tree when planted, proximity to building and the speed of growth. This measure has been
designed based on the assumption that savings would not be achieved for the first five years and would then be
realized from year 6 and for a further 20 years.
However, in order to simplify the implementation of this measure, a reduced savings is claimed from year 1 and for
an assumed measure life of 25 years, which results in an equivalent present value of lifetime savings. This results in
a 79% multiplier applied to the calculated annual savings for the measure.
If there is reason to believe that the length of time before savings are achieved is significantly different to the 5 years
assumed, an alternative multiplier can be applied.
